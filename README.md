# Zippies

This is the first-time check-in for an open source robot which includes...

1. 3D models built in SketchUp for the entire body of the robot that can be easily exported to STL files and printed on a 3D printer.
2. A schematic for a circuit designed to sense IR signals from a single HTC Vive Lighthouse to enable highly accurate (sub-millimeter) localized positioning and orientation.
3. A complete list of all the hardware required to build a Zippy.
4. All the software required to allow your Zippy robot to move around on your floor all by itself.
5. An iPhone app to aid in debugging over Bluetooth.

All of the items above are built and ready for check-in. I'm in the process now of organizing the directory structure to clean it up in preparation for check-in. I plan to make YouTube videos available in the coming days demoing the fully-assembled robot and going through the details of the assembly process. Stay tuned.
