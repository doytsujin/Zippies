# Zippies

This is the first-time check-in for an open source robot which includes...

1. A schematic for a circuit designed to sense IR signals from a single HTC Vive Lighthouse to enable highly accurate (sub-millimeter) localized positioning and orientation.
2. A complete list of all the hardware required to build a Zippy.
3. 3D models built in SketchUp for the entire body of the robot that can be easily exported to STL files and printed on a 3D printer.
4. An iPhone app to aid in debugging over Bluetooth.
5. All the software required to allow your Zippy robot to move around on your floor all by itself.

All of the items above are built and ready for check-in. I'm in the process now of organizing the directory structure to clean it up in preparation for check-in. Stay tuned.
