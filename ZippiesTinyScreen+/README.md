# Zippies for TinyScreen+

The following is a BOM to build a Zippy...

1. 1x [TinyScreen+](https://tinycircuits.com/collections/processors/products/tinyscreenplus) Main processor board plus battery charger, battery connector, and 96x64 full-color OLED screen.
2. 1x [290mAh Lithium Ion Battery](https://tinycircuits.com/products/lithium-ion-polymer-battery-3-7v-290mah) The battery.
3. 1x [Dual Motor Tinyshield](https://tinycircuits.com/products/dual-motor-tinyshield)
4. 1x [Proto-Board Tinysheild](https://tinycircuits.com/collections/proto-boards/products/proto-board-tinyshield?variant=14984618887) Be sure to get it with no top connector. It will get in the way of attaching the HTC Vive Lighthouse sensor circuit.
5. 2x [Micro Metal Gearmotors](https://www.pololu.com/product/2363) from Pololu.com.
6. 1x [Bluetooh Low Energy Tinyshield](https://tinycircuits.com/collections/communication/products/bluetooth-low-energy-tinyshield) Optional. Provides communication with the iOS app, useful for debugging.
