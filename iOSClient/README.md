# iPhone Client for Zippies

Run this on your phone, and it will automatically find and connect to a nearby Zippy. It will eventually need an update to allow selecting which Zippy to connect to when multiple are found, but that's on the "to do" list and unlikely to be a short-term issue.

Note that the emulator does not support the Bluetooth Low Energy profile, so the app will only function on a real device, which means that you'll need a iPhone developer account ($100/year) to install it on your phone.
